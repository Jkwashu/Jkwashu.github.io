    <h1 class="page-title">ICE WAVE MACHINE</h1>
      <p class="page-description"> The Ice Wave Machine is a new invention from European Union, in efforts to help 're-freeze' the Antarctic.
        Through a complex chemical process known as force-accelerated-exothermic-reaction, the Ice Wave Machine quickly turns any water particles in its way to ice.
        With this new machine many countries around the world have become more hopeful in the evergrowing battle of climate change.
        On Tuesday French President, Emmanuel Macron, said "I am looking very much forward to regrowing our Antartic together".</p>
